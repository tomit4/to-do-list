This is a second pass on my first coding project, the to-do-list.

A simple terminal project, this updated version of a To Do List Application attempts to organize the original code somewhat
and utilize CommonJS's module.exports and require functionalities.  I have divided up the code into three different
modules, the read, write, and save javascript files each read from the last, starting with the read.js file, and the user is intended
to run the save.js file as the final application.

I have also provided a samplelist.txt file should the user desire to import a premade To Do List.  When prompted for
the imported file name, simply type 'samplelist' in the text field, no '.txt' is required.

As before, make sure to install the 'prompt-sync' feature using npm, simply type into your command line:
npm install prompt-sync

Hopefully this is a bit of an improvement on the last to-do-list project. Enjoy!
