# to-do-list
My First Coding Project

This is my first Coding Project.  It is a basic To Do List generator that is capable of reading previous files in a .txt format and can save the changes made to a .txt file.  In its current state it generates a To Do List, organizes it by hour, minute, and AM/PM time parameters, and ouputs the results to the command prompt in Node JS.  Please note that in order to function properly, the user will require Node JS, and also install npm packages prompt-sync as well as fs modules.

In order to download these modules please enter the following command into the terminal:

npm install prompt-sync

npm install fs

This is a very basic project written in Vanilla Javascript. Enjoy!
